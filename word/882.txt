ACADEMIC PROJECT DETAILS
 (B.E) PROJECT TITLE: “FABRICATION OF AN AIRPREHEATER IN OIL FIRED FURNACE”  
                                                                          
An air preheater (APH) is a general term used to describe any device designed to heat air before another process (for example, combustion in a boiler) with the primary objective of increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a recuperative heat system or to replace a steam coil.

(DIPLOMA) PROJECT TITLE: “FABRICATION OF AN AUTOMATED GUIDED VECHILE”

Automated guided vehicle is a robot that can deliver the materials from supply area to the technician automatically. This is faster and more efficient.  The robot can access wirelessly. I.e. a technician can directly order the robot to deliver the components rather than the order it via a human operator. To avoid collision with human workers, a proximity detector has been added which causes the robot to stop as long as there is an obstacle in its way, thus avoiding accidents.
