Project Title: Power Market Senerio in India
Description:

A power market may be defined as a system for effecting purchases and sales through available options based on demand-supply dynamics. The Indian power market has transitioned from a sheltered structure, with limited players, to a dynamic and vibrant market with a large number of players and rapidly rising volumes. This has happened in a relatively short span of time, particularly after the Electricity Act of 2003 gave the necessary impetus. The Act recognized “power trading” as a distinct activity due to which short-term traded volumes and the number of market participants have been on a rise.
