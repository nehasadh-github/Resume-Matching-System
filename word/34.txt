Projects Undertaken

	•	Title:			CAN Protocol Implementation on Blue board (LPC2148).
Aim: 	The main aim of this project is to control the basis parameter of a vehicle. Different sensors have used in this project to measure various parameter like Temp. Sensor have used to get the temp. Value. This Project implemented on Blue board using external CAN circuitry.   


Software/Hardware used:        Keil IDE, Blue Board(LPC 2148) 
Programming Language:	Embedded C

	•	Title:		                Robotic Arm control using an Android Device.
Aim: 	We create an application in android which would allow the user to control the external hardware such as Robotic Arm in our case via Bluetooth so we build that application in Eclipse IDE which can transfer the data from Bluetooth of android device to the Bluetooth module which is connected to our microcontroller (AVR) and this data is used to drive the motor connected to the movable parts of robotic arm.
Software/Hardware used:        AVR studio, ATmega16 board.
Programming Language:	Embedded C
