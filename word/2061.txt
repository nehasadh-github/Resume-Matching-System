The Purpose of the Project was to simplify the current work flows (e.g., remove manual tasks, consolidate tasks) providing reduced manual effort and preparing for migration into Work Flow Management Platform (NEWTON) and new Order Capture Platform. The Project was divided into tracks for easy maintenance (TN Management, Customer Scheduling ,Order Capture, Workflow(OMS,CTH,LPP,SPP),Service Activation, Work Assignment, Digital Notifications).
CTH(Common Task Handler)
The tasks that comes from OMS(thick tasks) and OCX(Thin tasks) where to be handled in CTH.CTH was divided into CTH-HIR(Human Interaction Router) and CTH-WL, Sasha and AOTS.
CTH-HIR
CTH-HIR was where the tasks where to be routed accordingly viz to WL, Sasha, AOTS.  Separate rules are to be defined in for routing each task accordingly .Any task that is created will be found in CTH-HIR and from HIR it is routed according the rules declared in Routing table for each source system like OCX,OMX,SPP,LPP,CTH etc..
CTH-WL
CTH-WL is where a task can be completed ,assigned to any assignee for completion, unassign a task and claim a task. If the assignee feels the task is unable to be completed within the given time, then it can be deferred.
