Occupation or position held	Consultant for Safe Internet on the Desktop (PODVIS)

Main activities and responsibilities
 Project Description: DTO is looking for a scalable replacement for the current offering for 'safe internet traffic' on the internal Defense network. The current Citrix based 'Sandbox' infrastructure for 500 users is not scalable, as this will result in to high license and hardware costs. The IBM solution should scale from 1000 to 5000 concurrent users, with a total estimated user base of 60.000. This solution should preferably be based on Open Source components.

Project Contribution: My contribution to this RfP was the design of the complete infrastructure plus the software services that run in the environment: 5 Linux HA Clusters, a LVS load balancer for a Terminal Server Farm of 25 servers - based on Nomachine NX-, Linux firewall, Squid internet proxy with integrated virus scanner,
LDAP user database, NFS file server, DNS, DHCP, IDS, disk-image deployment server. I also built a limited demonstration environment where the
customer could test performance and stability. Appointed as technical lead, should the project continue after pilot stage.
