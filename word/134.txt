Project Details:

B.Tech:-
Project title    :   EFFECT OF COMBUSTION CHAMBER DESIGN ON PERFORMANCE OF CI ENGINE
                            FULFILLED WITH DIESEL
Team Size	   :  4 
 Position	   :  Data collector
Technology      :  TATA CNC MACHINE is used to make grooves on piston crown Single
                                  Cylinder I.C Engine
Description    : To change the design of combustion chamber design the piston head is made with hemi spherical grooves with specified configurations 3 grooves piston, 6 grooves piston, 9 grooves piston we have observed thermal efficiency has increased from 29.1 % to 39.1 % for 6 grooves piston the efficiency is low when compared to other two configured pistons and this design engine reduces the specific fuel consumption compared to the conventional engine.
