Numerical simulations predict unique quartz crystallographic fabric patterns for plane strain, ﬂattening, and constriction. Multiple studies support the predictions for plane strain and ﬂattening. To test predictions for constriction, this paper analyzes ﬁve examples of quartz crystallographic fabrics from a 1- km-wide domain of L tectonites in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone, Klamath Mountains, California,
U.S.A. These samples were deformed under greenschist- to amphibolite-facies conditions. Quartz c-axis fabrics are similar to the predicted double-girdle fabrics except that amphibolite-facies samples exhibit c- axis maxima and are distinctly asymmetrical about the elongation lineations. Activation of different slip systems combined with small deviations from pure constriction account for the c-axis maxima, and noncoaxial ﬂow accounts for the fabric asymmetry. The simple-shear component is randomly oriented in geographic coordinates throughout the domain of L tectonites.
These data conﬁrm that numerical simulations predict the quartz c-axis fabric geometry developed during constriction for some deformation conditions, and they conﬁrm the quartz a-axis patterns pre- dicted for constriction for the ﬁrst time. These data also demonstrate that the relationship between quartz crystallographic fabrics and strain geometry is not straightforward, and they indicate that a-axis fabrics may be more useful indicators of strain geometry variations.

	•	Introduction

Crystallographic fabrics are a common feature of plastically deformed rocks from the crust and the mantle. Quartz and olivine are the two most widely studied and well-understood minerals in terms of the crystallographic fabrics that develop during plastic deformation. Of these two, quartz is by far the most common mineral in crustal rocks exposed in the continents. Moreover, it is often concentrated by sedimentary processes or as vein ﬁll, so quartz-rich rocks are found in almost all continental metamorphic terranes. For these reasons, the development of quartz crystallo- graphic fabrics during plastic deformation has been an active area of research for more than four decades. Indeed, it is widely accepted that quartz crystallographic fabric formation and the resulting fabric geometry are sensitive to variations in deformation temperature and strain rate (Lister, 1981; Wenk et al., 1989; Jessell and Lister, 1990; Okudaira et al., 1995; Kruhl, 1998; Stipp et al., 2002a,b; Heilbronner and Tullis, 2006), the noncoaxiality of ﬂow

This sensitivity to different deformation parameters, combined with the relative ease of measuring them, makes quartz crystallographic fabrics an important tool for analyzing natural high-strain zones, and they have been used to characterize deformation in exhumed meta- morphic terranes from all over the world (e.g. Law  et al., 1984, 2004; Lee et al., 1987; Wallis, 1995; Xypolias and  Koukouvelas, 2001; Sullivan and Law, 2007; Toy et al., 2008; Barth et al., 2010).

Majoribanks, 1976; Tullis, 1977; Compton, 1980; Law et al., 1984; Price, 1985; Schmid and Casey, 1986; Law, 1986). However, well- documented natural fabrics produced under apparent constrictional strain conditions are rare in the literature, and constrictional deformation of rocks has not been reproduced in experiments. Because of this, Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) model remains the only link between quartz crystallographic fabric geometry and constrictional strain 30 years after its publication. As far as we are aware, only     a single sample from a single study has yielded both a measured prolate strain geometry and a double-girdle quartz c-axis fabric with girdles symmetrically arranged about the lineation (Burg and Teyssier, 1983 reproduced in Price, 1985) as predicted for pure con- strictional deformation by Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) model. To ﬁll this void, this paper presents ﬁve exceptionally well-documented examples of quartz crystallographic fabrics developed in a 1-km- wide domain of L tectonites in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone, Klamath Mountains, California, U.S.A. The quartz c-axis fabrics developed in these samples are similar to those predicted by Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) numerical simulations except that in four of the ﬁve samples exhibit c-axis maxima and the c-axis girdles are distinctly asymmetrical about the mineral elongation lineations. Phyllosilicate fabrics in these rocks deﬁne a weak, randomly oriented foliation not detectable by looking at the samples. Quartz crystallographic fabric geometry is unrelated to the weak phyllosi- licate foliation, and the fabric asymmetry is randomly oriented in   a geographic reference frame. These data show that Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) model does predict quartz c-axis fabric geometry during constrictional deformation for some deformation conditions. They also provide the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of the quartz a-axis patterns that Schmid and Casey (1986) predicted would form during con- strictional deformation. At the same time, these data demonstrate that the relationship between crystallographic fabric geometry and ﬁnite strain geometry is not as straightforward as generally assumed, especially for non-plane strain, noncoaxial deformations, and they indicate that a-axis fabrics may be more useful indicators of ﬁnite strain geometry under a variety of deformation conditions.

	•	Geologic setting

The samples documented in this study are from a 1-km-wide domain of well-developed L tectonites in the middle Jurassic Pigeon
 
Point high-strain zone, Klamath Mountains, California, U.S.A. (Wright and Fahan, 1988; Sullivan, 2009) (Fig. 2). The Pigeon Point high-strain zone is a gently SE-dipping zone of intense plastic deformation that cuts Jurassic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the western Hayfork terrane. Foliation surfaces in LeS- and L > S-tectonites in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone are shallowly to moderately dipping and poles to foliations deﬁne a partial great circle distribution roughly centered about the mineral elongation lineations (Fig. 2c). Elongation lineations, including the domain of L tectonites, plunge gently to the ESE (Fig. 2c). Overall, this pure-shear-dominated high-strain zone accommodated a subordinate component of top-to-the-WNW- directed, reverse-sense displacement coupled with zone-normal contraction and transport-parallel elongation (Sullivan, 2009). Sullivan (2009) concluded that the domain of L tectonites in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone accommodated a component of con- strictional deformation that was concentrated in a convex-upwards groove in the upper boundary of the high-strain zone. The geometry of the high-strain-zone boundary and resulting strain localizationwas likely related to magmatic heating that catalyzed intense plastic deformation in the ﬁrst place (Sullivan, 2009).

L tectonites in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone display a unique set of microstructural features on lineation-normal faces that also argue in favor of true constrictional deformation (Sullivan, 2009). Despite the strong mineral shape fabrics visible on lineation-parallel faces, there is no discernable mineral shape fabric visible on linea- tion-normal faces of L tectonites of all of the different rock types cut by the high-strain zone. Porphyroclasts in greenschist-facies L tec- tonites of the metavolcaniclastic unit show no shape preferred



orientation, and they are sometimes completely rimmed by seams of ﬁne-grained epidote, indicating pressure solution took place all the way around the clasts. Amphibole grains are oriented such that basal sections are commonly presented on lineation-normal faces, but their intermediate axes show little or no preferred orientation. In siliceous meta-argillites of the metasedimentary unit, basal cleavage traces of phyllosilicates in quartz-rich domains appear randomly oriented when viewed in lineation-normal sections, and quartz shows no grain shape preferred orientation (Fig. 3). These rocks also display 1e3-cm-scale compositional segregation with quartz-rich domains being completely encircled by 0.5e2-mm-thick phyllosili- cate-rich domains on lineation-normal faces. Within the phyllosili- cate-rich domains there is a weak phyllosilicate shape preferred orientation that is parallel with the domain boundaries. This indi- cates that the deformation of the phyllosilicate-rich domains was partially controlled by the rheologically stronger quartz-rich domains undergoing constrictional deformation.

	•	Sample locations

Three of the meta-argillite L tectonite samples; WH-04, WH-181, and WH-150; were collected from the domain of amphibolite-facies
 metamorphism near one of the maﬁc/ultramaﬁc composite dikes (Fig. 2b). WH-04 and WH-181 were collected within 10 m of each other. Another sample, WH-182, was collected at the edge of the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism, and a ﬁnal sample, WH-112, was collected from the greenschist-facies domain, well outside of the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism as mapped by Sullivan (2009) (Fig. 2b). WH-112 is also from a struc- turally higher position within the domain of L tectonites, closer to the high-strain-zone boundary (Fig. 2). An oriented sample of garnet amphibolite L tectonite used to provide deformation temperature estimates, WHT-04A, was collected by A. W. Snoke near the same maﬁc dike as the quartzite L tectonite samples (Fig. 2b).

In lineation-parallel sections of these samples quartz grains exhibit only a weak grain shape preferred orientation parallel with the mesoscopic lineation. Individual quartz grains in these sections appear as lobate to semi-polygonal grains, and 1200 grain- boundary intersections are common (Fig. 3). Extinction within quartz grains varies from sweeping undulose to nearly straight, and subgrains are generally semi-polygonal to polygonal in shape. Quartz grain boundaries are typically pinned by larger phyllosili- cate grains, but some smaller phyllosilicate grains are completely enveloped by large quartz grains. Quartz grain size is largest in domains with few or no phyllosilicate grains (Fig. 3). These obser- vations indicate that quartz in these samples underwent rapid grain-boundary-migration dynamic recrystallization with a high rate of recovery of intracrystalline strain. Phyllosilicate grains in lineation-parallel sections exhibit a strong grain shape preferred orientation parallel with the mesoscopic lineation (Fig. 3), and  some  phyllosilicate  grains   have  long-axis   dimensions   close   to
100 mm. Garnet grains in these samples are typically euhedral and are   concentrated   in   phyllosilicate-rich   domains.   A  1-cm-wide
granitoid dike cuts sample WH-181. Feldspar grains in this dike exhibit core-mantle structures. Feldspar cores exhibit sweeping or
patchy undulose extinction but few subgrains. Boundaries of relict feldspar grains exhibit 20e30-mm lobate sutures, and mantling neoblasts are typically less than 25 mm in diameter. These obser-
vations  indicate  that  feldspar  grains  in  this  sample  underwent
grain-boundary-bulging dynamic recrystallization.

 observed in this sample. There are distinct quartz grain size domains in this sample that are directly controlled by phyllosilicate and graphite concentration. These observations indicate that quartz in this sample underwent sweeping grain-boundary-migration dynamic recrystallization and minor subgrain-rotation dynamic recrystallization. As in the other samples phyllosilicate grains exhibit a strong grain shape preferred orientation in the lineation- parallel section. Biotite and muscovite grains are noticeably smaller
in this sample, and their long-axis dimensions rarely exceed 30 mm. Garnet  commonly  appears  as  fractured  and/or  skeletal  grains in
direct contrast to the pristine euhedral grains observed in the other samples.

truncated by the fractures. Chlorite is locally present growing in fractures between garnet grains, but no replacement textures were observed. Some biotite grains are partially replaced by chlorite.

(a) Data collected in lineation- parallel thin sections. The dashed great circles represent the foliations from the phyllosilicate orientation analyses in Fig. 4. (b) Data collected in lineation-perpendicular thin sections and viewed in the lineation-parallel reference frame as in a. Quartz c axes measured in a lineation-parallel thin section of WH-150 using a light microscope equipped with a universal stage. All plots are equal-area, lower-hemisphere projections, and the lineations lie at 090, 2700 . Contours are multiples of uniform density (MUD).


conﬁrm this, we determined the long-axis orientations of approx- imately 500 phyllosilicate grains in quartz-rich domains of each of the meta-argillite L tectonite samples by measuring the angle of inclination to an arbitrary axis in lineation-perpendicular sections.
 Two criteria were used in these analyses: (1) the grains must not be in visible contact with phases other than quartz, and (2) the grains must have an axial ratio of at least 3:1. We omitted grains with axial ratios less than 3:1 because the large-axial-ratio grains are most


likely to provide a sensitive indicator of any shape preferred orientations.  The  results   of   these   analyses   were  rotated   into a common geographic reference frame (Fig. 4a).
In all ﬁve of the meta-argillite L tectonite samples long axes of phyllosilicate grains are distributed over a 1800 arc. However, there is a distinct phyllosilicate orientation maximum, hereon referred to as a foliation, in each sample. The inclination values of the foliations were determined visually using a rose diagram, and the strike and dip of the foliations was determined from the sample orientation markers by geometric construction. The strike and dip values of the foliations found using this method range from 301, 79-NE to 075, 25-SE (Fig. 4b). Values for the two adjacent samples, WH-04 and WH-181, are similar. These results indicate that: (1) there is a weak foliation in all of the meta-argillite L tectonite samples that is not detectable without a quantitative analysis, (2) the orientation of the weak foliation is consistent over a few meters, and (3) the orien- tation of the weak foliation is very inconsistent throughout the domain of L tectonites.

	•	Deformation temperature estimates

Dynamic recrystallization of both quartz and feldspar is strongly dependent on deformation temperature and strain rate (Tullis and Yund, 1987; Hirth and Tullis, 1992; Stipp et al., 2002a). In the three samples from the  amphibolite-facies  domain;  WH- 04, WH-181, and WH-150; quartz underwent rapid grain- boundary-migration dynamic recrystallization. Feldspar grains in WH-181 record extensive grain-boundary-bulging dynamic recrystallization. Assuming typical geologic strain rates of 10-13e10-14,  these  observations  indicate  deformation  tempera- tures were in excess of 450 0C, but less than 600 0C (Tullis and Yund, 1985, 1987; Hirth and Tullis, 1992; Stipp et al., 2002a,b). Quartz grains in sample WH-182, collected at the edge of the amphibolite-facies domain, also underwent rapid grain- boundary-migration recrystallization, but 1200 grain-boundary intersections are less common. Hence we infer that it experienced slightly lower deformation temperatures than WH-04, WH-181,  and WH-150, but was probably still deformed at temperatures in excess of 450 0C (Hirth and Tullis, 1992; Stipp et al., 2002a,b). Sample WH-112, collected outside of the domain of amphibolite- facies metamorphism, exhibits evidence for both rapid grain- boundary-migration and local subgrain-rotation dynamic recrystallization of quartz, indicating deformation under upper- greenschist-facies conditions of 400e500 0C (Hirth and Tullis,  1992; Stipp et al., 2002a,b).
The presence of brown biotite in greenschists of the lower metavolcaniclastic unit  indicates  deformation  temperatures  in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone outside of the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism were in  the  upper  range  of  the greenschist facies (Bucher and Frey, 1994, p. 275e276). The presence of hornblende with brown pleochrosim in amphibolites indicates that rocks in this domain reached middle amphibolite- facies conditions. Amphibole, garnet, and plagioclase in sample WHT-04A were analyzed by wavelength dispersive spectrometry on the Cameca SC-100 electron microprobe at the University of Maine. Analytical conditions were 15-kV accelerating voltage, 10-
nA beam current, and 5-mm beam. Data were calibrated with mineral  and  synthetic  standards,  and processed  using  the X-Phi
correction of Merlet (1994). Amphibole compositions are pre- sented in Table 1. Garnet is predominantly Alm61e64 Prp12e15 Grs13e15 Sps8e9 (Table 2). Plagioclase is An31e44 (Table 3). Using these data, the garnet-hornblende-plagioclase-quartz barometer of Kohn and Spear (1990) and the garnet-hornblende ther- mometer of Graham and Powell (1984) yield equilibrium condi- tions  of  5.7e7.5  kb  and  625e750  0C  (Calculations conducted

The thermometry calculations provide an upper deformation temperature bound for the amphibolites, because the last stages of deformation are associated with retrograde metamorphism of these rocks.

These data were collected in a grid pattern with a step size much larger than the average grain size. This dataset is similar to the EBSD datasets from the same sample (Fig. 5), and it provides an addi- tional veriﬁcation of the SEM-EBSD analyses.

	•	Samples WH-04, WH-181, WH-150, and WH-182

Samples WH-04, WH-181, and WH-150 from the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism and sample WH-182 from the edge of the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism yield comparable quartz crystallographic fabric patterns. To facilitate visualization  and   interpretation,   these   fabrics   are   plotted   in a variety of different lineation-parallel reference frames including:
(1) in a vertical plane containing the lineation so that they are viewed towards the NNE (Fig. 5), (2) perpendicular to the foliation detected by the phyllosilicate orientation analyses (Fig. 6), and (3) with the fabrics rotated so that the c-axis maxima lie along the  EeW great circles and the a-axis maxima lie near the primitives (Fig. 7a). In these samples c-axis patterns contain distinct maxima within diffuse small-circle girdles offset from the center of the  plots. The a-axis patterns are characterized by diffuse small-circle girdles centered about the lineations with weaker maxima that are asymmetrically distributed about the lineations. Average opening angles of c-axis girdles about the lineations are 151e1640, and average opening angles of a-axis girdles are 58e640 (Figs. 6 and 7a, Table 4). Note that these opening angle values were measured in reference frames wherein the c- and a-axis maxima lie along the primitives, and they change slightly depending on which reference frame the fabrics are viewed in. Depending the reference frame used, the c-axis patterns can appear as a single small-circle girdle with a distinct maxima offset from the center of the plot or a pair of asymmetrical partial small-circle girdles with distinct maxima near the primitives (Figs. 5e7a). We emphasize that these are essentially the same fabric patterns with the maxima oriented differently with respect to geographic horizontal. When viewed in the foliation- perpendicular reference frame, the c-axis maxima lie near the primitives (Fig. 6).

The maximum ﬁnite elongation direction lies at 090, 2700 . (b) Cartoon depicting the three- dimensional geometry of the crystallographic fabric patterns in a (Inspired by R.D. Law). Note the two symmetrical cones of c axes and the corresponding symmetrical cones of a axes.
 Lineation-parallel and lineation-perpendicular sections of samples WH-04, WH-181, and WH-150 yield very similar crystallo- graphic fabrics when viewed in the same reference frame (Fig. 5). This indicates that the crystallographic fabrics are homogeneous at the hand sample scale and that the maxima are not a function of an orientation-based sampling bias in our data collection. Samples WH- 04 and WH-181 yield opposite maxima orientations when viewed in the same reference frame, however (Fig. 5). This indicates that the crystallographic fabrics are not homogeneous at the 10-m-scale.

	•	Sample WH-112

Sample WH-112, collected from outside the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism as mapped by Sullivan (2009), yields a distinctly different quartz crystallographic fabric pattern from the other four samples. Its c-axis pattern consists of well- deﬁned small-circle girdles with an average opening angle about the lineation of 1270, and its a-axis pattern consists of well-deﬁned small-circle girdles with an average opening angle about the

Note that these opening angle values were measured in the plot depicted in Fig. 7b and they change slightly when the data are viewed in different reference frames. The small-circle girdles of c axes are joined in one part of the plot producing a  pattern between a  type-II cross girdle  and    a true double-girdle fabric predicted for pure constrictional defor- mation by Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) simulation (Figs. 1 and 7b). Interestingly, the location where the two c-axis girdles join lies very near the pole to the weak foliation deﬁned by the phyllosilicate orientation analyses (Fig. 6).

	•	Overview of important factors
Three factors are commonly cited as inﬂuencing quartz crystallo- graphic fabric geometry: (1) the dominant active slip system which is a function of deformation temperature and strain rate, (2) the distortional strain geometry, and (3) the noncoaxiality of ﬂow. For plane-strain deformations the dominant active slip system typically controls the location of fabric maxima (Lister, 1981; Wenk et al., 1989; Jessell and Lister, 1990). The link between strain geometry and crys- tallographic fabric geometry is well established for plane strain and ﬂattening strain (Tullis et al., 1973; Majoribanks, 1976; Tullis, 1977; Compton, 1980; Law et al., 1984; Price, 1985; Schmid and Casey, 1986; Law, 1986), but it remains tenuous for constrictional strain. Most workers agree that the noncoaxiality of ﬂow controls the symmetry of the fabric with respect to the ﬁnite strain ellipsoid during plane strain deformation (e.g. Dell’Angelo and Tullis, 1989; Law et al., 1990; Wallis, 1995; Takeshita et al., 1999), but little is known about how the noncoaxiality of ﬂow inﬂuences quartz crys- tallographic fabric geometry for constrictional or ﬂattening
 deformations. To better interpret our data, we consider each of these factors as possible inﬂuences on the geometry of the crystallographic fabrics.

	•	Inﬂuence of noncoaxial of ﬂow
Noncoaxial ﬂow is the only way to explain the asymmetry of the crystallographic fabrics in the high-temperature samples. Data from all of these samples can be rotated so that the plots exhibit  two small-circle girdles of c axes with maxima at the plot primitive and two distinctly asymmetrical small-circle girdles of a axes with maxima about 5e100 from the EeW great circle (Fig. 10b). This is similar to viewing the samples in the foliation-perpendicular reference frame (Fig. 6). In three dimensions the c axes form two half-cone-shaped clusters with opening angles of 151e1640 that appear on opposite sides of the median line deﬁned by the lineation
 (Fig. 10b). The a axes of each sample form two cone-shaped clusters with one half of each cone containing many more a axes than the other, and the highest a-axis densities are offset about 5e100 from the median line deﬁned by the lineation (Fig. 10b). The consistent asymmetry of the a-axis maxima with respect to the lineation gives these samples a monoclinic crystallographic fabric geometry best explained by noncoaxial ﬂow. Because they are dominated by prism a slip, the presumed principal slip plane is consistently at a high angle to the weak foliation deﬁned by the phyllosilicate orientation analyses (Fig. 6). Therefore, either the shear plane of the simple- shear component was at a high angle to these weak foliations or the simple-shear component of deformation was preferentially accommodated by basal a slip under amphibolite-facies condi- tions. Because the a-axis fabrics in the high-temperature samples exhibit the most asymmetry across a plane roughly perpendicular to the c-axis maxima (Fig. 10), we favor the latter of these two hypotheses and propose that the c-axis maxima approximate the pole to the shear plane of the simple-shear component of defor- mation recorded by the quartz grains. In such case, the weak foli- ation deﬁned by the phyllosilicate grains probably formed in response to grain-boundary sliding between phyllosilicate and quartz grains that accommodated a signiﬁcant portion of the simple-shear component of deformation in these samples. This coeval strain-path partitioning between different slip systems in quartz and between different deformation mechanisms in the rocks can also explain the apparent high angles between the XeY planes of the ﬁnite strain ellipsoids deﬁned by the crystallographic fabrics and the weak foliations deﬁned by the phyllosilicate grains.

understanding of how constrictional deformation was accommo- dated in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone. Because the crystallo- graphic fabric maxima in the high-temperature samples are randomly oriented when the samples are viewed in the same geographic reference frame, it seems unlikely that a component of noncoaxial ﬂow in these samples is related to the overall kinematic geometry of the high-strain zone. Instead, we propose that the noncoaxial deformation recorded in these samples acted as a series of outcrop-scale conjugate faults in a cone-shaped array similar to that envisioned for quartz glide planes and a axes at the micro- scopic scale. If, however, this kind of process played a dominant role in the constrictional deformation recorded at Pigeon Point, then there should be evidence at the outcrop scale such as discrete zones of greater deformation intensity or small systematic variations in the orientation of the mesoscopic lineations, but we see no evidence of such strain partitioning at the outcrop scale. Therefore, it seems unlikely that any component of noncoaxial ﬂow recorded in the high-temperature samples played a dominant role in accommodating constrictional deformation in the Pigeon Point high-strain zone. Finally, if the high-temperature samples record appreciable components of simple shear, then there was probably some amount of deformation-path partitioning between quartzites in the domain of amphibolite-facies metamorphism and quartzite L tectonites outside of this domain, because the lower-temperature sample, WH-112, yields a much more symmetrical fabric.

	•	Sample WH-112

Sample WH-112 is much easier to interpret. Its c-axis pattern consists of two nearly symmetrical small-circle girdles with average opening angles about the lineation of 1270 and its a-axis pattern consists of two nearly symmetrical small-circle girdles with average opening angles about the lineation of 650 (Fig. 7b). Hence, we inter- pret WH-112 as recording pure-shear-dominated, near-constrictional deformation. The small-circle c-axis girdles join in one part of the plot producing a pattern between a type-II cross girdle and a true double-



girdle fabric predicted for pure constrictional deformation by Lister and Hobbs’ (1980) numerical simulation (Figs. 1 and 7b). If the point where the two c-axis girdles meet does indeed deﬁne the XeY plane of the ﬁnite strain ellipsoid, then this plane is nearly orthogonal to the weakly developed foliation in this sample (Fig. 6). Following our argument that the quartz crystallographic fabrics not the mineral shape fabrics provide the best record of the kinematic framework imposed upon the quartz grains, we propose that the data from WH- 112 is an excellent example of a quartz crystallographic fabric formed during nearly coaxial, near-constrictional deformation of quartzite under upper-greenschist-facies conditions. The phyllosilicate shape fabric in this sample may also record a component of noncoaxial deformation accommodated by grain-boundary sliding between phyllosilicate and quartz grains, but this noncoaxial deformation is not recorded by the quartz crystallographic fabric.
Sample WH-112 provides additional evidence that Lister and
Hobbs’ (1980) numerical simulation predicts quartz c-axis fabric geometry during constrictional deformation under some deforma- tion conditions. The a-axis fabric patterns in this sample and in the high-temperature samples also provide the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of Schmid and Casey’s (1986) prediction that small-circle girdles of a axes with opening angles of about 600 will form symmetrically about the maximum ﬁnite elongation direction during constrictional deformation. Note that this lower-temperature sample has the smallest c-axis girdle opening angles of any of the samples. This observation favors the hypothesis that the opening angles of quartz c-axis girdles formed during constrictional deformation increase with increasing deformation temperatures given a constant a-axis girdle opening angle.

	•	Conclusions

The lower-temperature sample, WH-112, exhibits two well- deﬁned c-axis girdles symmetrically distributed about the lineation as predicted by Lister and Hobbs (1980). As such it provides addi- tional evidence that these numerical simulations predict quartz c-axis fabric geometry during constrictional deformation under some deformation conditions. Our results also conﬁrm Schmid and Casey’s (1986) prediction that small-circle a-axis girdles with opening angles of approximately 600 will form about the maximum ﬁnite elongation direction during constrictional deformation. Moreover, in the high-temperature samples the a-axis girdles are more consistent and better developed than the small-circle c-axis girdles, and we propose that quartz a-axis fabrics are a better tool for analyzing ﬁnite strain geometry under a variety of deformation conditions than the c-axis fabrics. Because of the variable sensi- tivities to different deformation parameters of the two crystallo- graphic fabric components, we argue that, whenever possible, quartz a-axis fabrics should be published alongside quartz c-axis data. Additionally, the smaller c-axis girdle opening angles
 observed in sample WH-112 argue in favor of the hypothesis that the opening angles of c-axis girdles formed during constrictional deformation will increase with increasing deformation tempera- ture given a constant a-axis girdle opening angle. This apparent sensitivity to different deformation parameters could be a boon to geologists trying to understand high-strain zones with signiﬁcant domains of constrictional strain where traditional kinematic anal- ysis techniques cannot be applied due to the lack of a foliation reference frame. Therefore, we emphasize that more research in this area is needed. In particular numerical simulations need to be developed to explore the effects of variably oriented pure-shear and simple-shear deformation components on the development of quartz crystallographic fabrics.
