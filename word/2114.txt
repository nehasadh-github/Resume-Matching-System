Environmental Consultant to Individual Dairy Producers and Dairy Producers of New Mexico, GGI. Worked on environmental compliance and permitting for individual dairies and collected and compiled literature on the fate of hormones associated with concentrated animal feeding operations.
Ecological Consultant to City of Los Angeles, Pacifica Services, Inc.
As part of a large-scale project ensuring future water supply to the city of Los Angeles and the maintenance of healthy vegetation in Owens Valley, I managed several tasks within the project: successional vegetation dynamics following agricultural abandonment; relationship between groundwater depth and individual plant species; relationship between vegetation productivity and water availability. I managed and budgeted tasks, participated in project meetings, and coordinated with client personnel. I designed experiments and supervised staff in vegetation data collection, collected and analyzed vegetation dynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored manuscripts, reports and presentations. I further parameterized and assisted with EDYS updates, a landscape-level ecological model. 2003 - 2005
Visiting Professor and Postdoctoral Research Assistant, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors affecting photosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO2 to develop seasonal gas exchange model. Designed field and greenhouse experiments and participated in proposal writing. Supervised undergraduate assistants. 2000 – 2002
Ecophysiological Research Assistant, Duke University
Designed and conducted experiments testing for species differences in dynamic photosynthetic responses to changes in light intensity in ambient and elevated CO2. Coded and parameterized dynamic photosynthesis model. Maintained photosynthesis analyzers, data loggers, “baby-Kucera” sapflow gauges, radiation sensors. 1996 - 2000
Ecological Research Assistant, Northern Arizona University
Designed and conducted field study on the relationship between ponderosa pine stand structure, light environment and grass species presence and abundance as well as a greenhouse experiment evaluating effect of shade on native grass species. Hired, trained, and supervised student workers for biomass harvest. Assisted professor in writing McIntire-Stennis proposal to fund thesis research. 1994 - 1996
Chemical Research Technician, Northern Arizona University
Set up laboratory and gas chromatographs for resin acid and terpene analysis. Adapted resin acid analysis to ponderosa pine needles. 1994
Greenhouse Research Aide, Northern Arizona University
Propagated and maintained tree seedlings in greenhouse facility for field
