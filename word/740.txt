Hydraulic Turbine Based on Pelton Wheel:-
Pelton turbine (wheel) is use to convert hydraulic energy in to mechanical energy followed by electrical       energy.
Pelton turbines (wheel) are suitable for power extraction, when the water energy is available at high head and low flow rate. Pelton turbine is most efficient at this condition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high pressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even when the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in all sizes.
