PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Technically-savvy electrical design engineer expertized in planning, design, and testing of the electrical components and electromechanical systems. Qualifications include Master’s degree from VIT University, Vellore specialized in Power Electronics and Drives, Experienced in commercial software’s like MATLAB, ANSYS, PSIM etc.
EXPERIENCE 
Worked as a Intern (Electrical Engineer) in SCM DATA, Hyderabad   8 Jun 2016 to 22 Dec 2017
	•	Design of EV (Electric Vehicle) Motor 
Description: Electric vehicle motors are the most popular motors and upcoming generation is totally related with the EV motors to reduce emissions from vehicles. EV motors are operated through the Power electronic devices and batteries. The AC motors are most popular due to the VFD (Variable frequency drives). AC motors are most efficient and economical for medium and high loads.
	Design of Induction motors 70kW and 120kW for electric vehicles. Particularly involvement in this project is design and development of electric motor parts based on theoretical calculations done by hand after implemented in excel and numerical solutions implemented in FEA software. Design of new product development and reverse engineering done for electric vehicle applications.
Roles and Responsibilities:
Responsible for providing Theoretical and numerical simulations using Ansys Electromagnetic suite and MATLAB. Involved in product and process design of electromechanical systems and vehicle dynamics and pre- requirements of motors.
Duties include,
	•	Design of 70kW and 120kW motors based on the vehicle requirement.
	•	Design of new product development for different electrical parts.
	•	Research and develop ideas for new product and production systems.
	•	Deliver product based theoretical calculations.
	•	Provide design support at all stages of design process to internal members and external clients.
	•	Improve the design, performance, and optimization of existing products.
	•	Enhance cost efficiency of products with set quality standards of the company.
Software’s: ANSYS Electromagnetic suite (RMxPRT, Mawell2D/3D, Simplorer) and MATLAB
