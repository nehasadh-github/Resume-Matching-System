 	ACADEMIC PROJECT	
Project Title: BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR SMART HOME CONTROL
Description: The aim of this project was to control the switch ON/OFF of a fan and light automatically by using brain commands such as attention level and eye blink level so that there was no need for physical movement. The Brain computer interface module absorbed these brain commands, which consists of Electroencephalography (EEG). Then these data signals sent to microcontroller to control the switch.
