ACADEMIC PROJECT

PROJECT TITLE : UNDER GROUND CABLE FAULT DISTANCE LOCATOR
DESCRIPTION :
 The aim of this project is to determine the fault location of underground cable from base station by using microcontroller.

 This project uses the simple concept of OHM’s law. When any fault like short circuit occurs, voltage drop will vary depending on the length of fault in cable, since the current varies.
 we detect the exact location of short circuit fault in the underground cable from feeder end in kilometers by using microcontroller 8051. So, it can be easily detected and repaired.
