TITLE:”CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FOR MILITORY  APPLICATION”.
              FOR MILITORY  APPLICATION”



Project Description:
“The art of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format, called cipher text. Only those who possess a secret key can decipher the message into plain text. Encrypted messages can sometimes be broken by cryptanalysis, also called codebreaking, although modern cryptography techniques are virtually unbreakable .As the Internet and other forms of electronic communication become more prevalent, electronic security is becoming increasingly important. Cryptography is used to protect e-mail messages, credit card information, and corporate data. One of the most popular cryptography systems used on the Internet is Pretty Good Privacy because it's effective and free. 
This project is based on this on”symmetric key cryptography”. An encryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message share a single, common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Symmetric-key systems are simpler and faster, but their main drawback is that the two parties must somehow exchange the key in a secure way.
