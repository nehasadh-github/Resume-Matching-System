Within 1-3 business I receive an email from SAGA that my artwork is en-route to my home address.


	I’m excited to get my artwork, but don’t know how to hang or maintain it, so I book an appointment with a SAGA volunteer through a “Need Help?” link in the email.

I encounter the Art Rental hallway and see
artwork I am interested in learning about, but the gift shop is closed.
I look at the artwork’s product listing. I look through the sample images, but want to see how it would look in my patient room. I click
on “View in another environment”.
I am presented a list of room types and
 	     select the “Oﬃce” category and ﬁnd a room
that looks like a patient room.
I navigate to “Browse Our Art” in the menu. I see a list of artwork for rent or purchase.
The art is projected onto my patient room image and even looks like it was hung. I like how it looks so I decide to rent it.
I am brought to the openGallery homepage and see featured art for display.
I am prompted to join SAGA’s membership program before I am able to rent out the artwork. I ﬁll and submit the membership form. After submitting it, I return to completing the rental application.
I complete the rental application and receive a conﬁrmation email with a receipt of my new business membership.
The day my artwork arrives a SAGA volunteer visits my home to help me hang it. I am pleased with the experience, as they also answer my questions about maintenance and returning the artwork.

THINKING

Where can I ﬁnd the paintings on the display?
 How much paintings does SAGA have available for rent or purchase?

Who can I ask if I am interested in artwork that is currently being rented out?
 What options do I have for frames?

How would this make my patients feel?
 Why do I have to become a member before renting artwork?

Can I cancel my rental or membership application if I change my mind?
 How long will it take for the artwork to arrive?

Who can I talk to about bulk renting artwork for the rest of my oﬃce?







SAGA’S GOALS

Make art accessible and exciting for everyone, including visitors.
 Share and advertise artwork by SAGA artists to the general public.
 Ensure that the user of the website receives a personalized experience.
 Persuade the visitor to sign-up for a SAGA membership.
 Ensure that newly-joined business members know that they are appreciated and supported.
