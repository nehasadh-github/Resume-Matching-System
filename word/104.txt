 Summer Internship Synopsis	

	•	Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station, Gandhinagar.
	•	Objective : To understand all about Power system equipments.
	•	Duration : 12 days.

	•	Company: Larsen and Toubro (Electrical and Automation) Ltd, Vadodara.
	•	Objective : To learn about construction of MCCB theoretically and practically, how to make assembly  of MCCB in production side, test carried out by company as per standard IEC 60947-2 after made assembly of MCCB and Pro-E software which used for designing of MCCB.
	•	Duration : 1 month. (May 2014-June 2014)

 Engineering Project Synopsis (Industrial Training)	

	•	Project Title : Analysis on Electromagnetic Repulsion Force for Enhancement in Repulsion Threshold Current of Contact System of 250 A Frame MCCB.
	•	Company: Larsen and Toubro (Electrical and Automation) Ltd, Vadodara.
	•	Objective : This project is initiated by carrying out detailed study of the factors and design constraints related to repulsion threshold current (Irp) of the MCCB. Present design analyzed on JMAG/ANSYS Maxwell to find out their limitations, Based on that find out simulation results & new concepts for contact system of the MCCB is generate. Project objective is to enhance repulsion threshold current (Irp) of contact system of 250 A frame MCCB. Electromagnetic repulsion forces generated between moving & fixed contacts are of repulsive nature due to opposite direction of current path. The mechanical force offered by MCCB mechanism opposes these Electromagnetic repulsion forces. In this project contact pressure (CP) offered by contact springs will be a constant.
	•	Duration: 1 year (July 2014-April 2015)

	•	Project Title : Generator Protection & Testing of Relays.
	•	Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station, Gandhinagar.
	•	Objective : The objective of this project is to understand all about generator protection schemes & their settings, testing of some protection relay using micro-controller. To protect the generator against the over current, differential and turbine to boiler trip with help of instantaneous micro-controller based relay, one can practically implement this program. Programming is done in Code Vision AVR software and simulated in Proteus software. Result of this simulation is implemented in hardware. Hardware results are same as software result. These programs can be used as reference in power plant industries.
	•	Duration: 1 year. (June 2011-May 2012)
