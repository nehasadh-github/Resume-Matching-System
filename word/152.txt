M.Sc.  PROJECT REPORT ON				
“Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of N-Substituted Succinaamide”
A SHORT  RESEARCH  PROJECT :-
A research project on “synthesis and antibacterial activities of N-substituted succinamide compounds”	succinamide compound used as therapeutic agents interesting for the synthesis of biologically active compounds aniline and its derivative exhibit variety of biologically active action antibacterial ,antiviral, anticancer and antifungal agents succinamide is well arthritic diseases eye diseases such as the proliferative retinopathies. Neovascular glaucoma and ocular tumors angiofibromas, and hemangiomass.      
Previously dual antitumor  and anti-inflammatory activity of a series substituted succcinamic acid have reported (1-4) synthesis and biologically activity of substituted amides and hydrazides 1,4 dicarboxylic acids have been recently reviewed in an novel succinamide as antitumour.Succinamide derivatives processes for their prepration and their use as gelatlnase and collagenase  inhibitors.
Antibacterial activity efficiency of N-substituted succinamide compound against two bacterial species viz. Staphylococcus aurecus and protease vulgaries.
All the compounds like
1-phenyl pyrrolidine 2,5 dione
1(4-methyl phenyl)pyrrlidine2,5 dione
P-methoxy N-phenyl succinamide
N,N(4,4 Diphenyl methane)succinamide
Shows antibacterial efficiency for this species
