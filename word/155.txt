Title	                : Optimizing cloud Resources for delivering IPTV          service through virtualization.
       Team Size          : 2
       Environment      : ASP.NET,SQL SERVER

Description:
	•	Virtualized cloud-based services can take advantage of statistical multiplexing across applications to yield significant cost savings. However, achieving similar savings with real-time services can be a challenge.
	•	we seek to lower a provider’s costs for real-time IPTV services through a virtualized IPTV architecture and through intelligent time-shifting of selected services. Using Live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD) as examples, we show that we can take advantage of the different deadlines associated with each service to effectively multiplex these services
