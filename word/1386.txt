PROJECT REPORT:

	•	PROJECT TITLE: Modeling and Simulation of Matrix Converter Based DC-DC Converter

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The modeling and simulation of DC-DC converter with matrix converter as its basic topology. DC- DC converters are frequently utilized in traction motor speed control and switched mode power supply. Control of speed of dc motor is specially required where supply is dc voltage Matrix converter does not have energy storage components as compared to conventional converters which use energy storage components..  In this paper, DC-DC converter is proposed to generate a variable dc voltage from a fixed dc voltage using single phase matrix converter topology that has been used in direct AC-AC converter application. State space modeling is developed taking currents as state variables. But using inductance in load generates some distortions in output of converter. As frequency is increased distortions in the output of the converter get reduced for inductive load. The DC-DC converter is based on four quadrant operation of chopper and the output of converter is synthesized by using PWM technique.

	•	PROJECT TITLE: GSM BASED STEPPER MOTOR SPEED CONTROL

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The goal of the project is to develop a system, which uses Mobile technology that keeps control of STEPPER MOTORS in different applications, which executes with respect to the signal sent by the mobile. For utilization of appliances the new concept has been thought to manage them remotely by using mobile, which enables the user to remotely switching and controlling of STEPPER motor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique. Just by dialing keypad of remote telephone, from where you are calling you can perform ON / OFF and at the same time we can control the speed of Stepper motor operation. The ranges of appliances that can be controlled through tele remote systems are many in numbers.  Some of them are as follows and this depends upon the usage priority of the appliances i.e. parking Lights, Music System or other electrical / electronic appliances.
