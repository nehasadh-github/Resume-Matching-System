COVER LETTER                      
Dear Sir,											,
I would like to take this opportunity to express my interest in the Biomedical Equipment Technician position that has recently become available with your Hospital.
I have held this position for the last 7 years at a well-established facility and I have extensive knowledge in handling all types of hospital equipment. My experience includes installing the equipment and checking it to make sure everything is working correctly after installation.
I also perform regular maintenance checks to confirm the equipment is functioning correctly and I have the knowledge and ability to spot problems before they occur during inspections. In the event there is a problem, I have the ability to repair the equipment and get it back up and running again in a timely manner.
I have experience checking and repairing everything from hospital beds to x-ray machines. I also have excellent verbal skills, which gives me the ability to communicate with staff and physicians to learn what problems they are having with the equipment. In the event I need to repair equipment in the presence of patients, I can make them feel comfortable and relaxed while they wait.
I am available to be “on call” when needed because I understand that when equipment fails, you need it repaired right away. I can also travel to various locations if it becomes necessary. I am organized, dependable and I have a good eye for detail. I hope to put my training and skills to work for your facility in the near future.
You can reach me by calling or whatsap  00971555493799 or 00971501203583 and I am always available for an interview.
Sincerely,
Noor islam
Noor islam
