Accounting Professional

I consider myself a versatile, productive worker with a solid work ethic who exerts optimal effort to ensure all tasks are completed on time and to the highest standards. I carry a dynamic, results-oriented skill with the ability to easily grasp and put into application new ideas, concepts, and methods and equipped with the following:

	•	A way with numbers - I like working with facts and figures
	•	A passion for detail - I am naturally precise
	•	A love of solitude - I love working in a group or in an environment where the nature of the work does not promote a lot of social interaction or togetherness. 

I have more than 10 years of experience in accounting sector. I initially worked in Accenture (Philippines) where I have been exposed to a fast-paced and challenging atmosphere. With my positive 'can do' attitude, I continued my career in different local offices to gain broad experience in bookkeeping, tax, accounting, and audit. 

After qualifying my experience, I joined Maersk Group. I started in Maersk Filipinas and moved to Maersk GSC for different accounting responsibilities. My major role was focused on SAP process mapping & alignment, transferring knowledge-based Finance and Accounting processes and delivering successful project execution.

A combination of my natural ability, technical expertise and work experience made me an ideal candidate in different companies where I was given a busy role in implementing a system, developing process improvements and aligning the process to the new accounting system.

My biggest accomplishment was my role as a Business Process Expert in Maersk Group where I was given cross-country assignments abroad and exposure in supervising a team size covering more than 40 goal-driven people.
