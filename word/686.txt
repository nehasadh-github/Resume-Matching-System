Main project:
                                                        Spy Communication System

Description

As we know that in present time internet crime is increasing constantly. There are so many who can easily hack the private or secure conversation or data so it is necessary to make the data secure for transmission. A spy communication system deals with that all. It uses encrptography and steganography to make the data secure. In encryptography the meaningful data is used to be converted in a ciphertext using a pseudo random key which only can be reconstructed into meaningful message using decryption process using the same key used by the sender of the message whereas in steganography the data used to be hidden behind some image file or mp3 or video.So using both the method together the data can be made more secure and undetectable for the transmission specially a private or scientific conversation.
