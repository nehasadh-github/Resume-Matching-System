Achievements

I was a member of the Marketing and Finance Project team at Langside College, Glasgow. I was responsible for marketing the new design of LED brake lights for bicycles. To achieve this I had to approach the customers in a polite yet convincing manner. I completed this project successfully and I strongly believe that the project has improved my teamwork, communication and numerical skills immensely. I have achieved a Fraud Control award that was given by the Capital Market Authority for attending a training press conference in Al Madina Insurance.
