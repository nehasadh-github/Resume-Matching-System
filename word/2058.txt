RE: Electrical Engineering Internship

Dear Dr. Fields,

	My academic advisor, Professor Sam Singleton, informed me about an electrical engineering internship at McDuff, where he worked until last year. I am writing to apply for the position.

	I understand that McDuff is making a major effort to build a full-scale equipment development laboratory. That prospect interests me greatly, because of my academic background in electrical engineering. At CSULB, I took courses in several subjects that might be useful in the lab’s work – for example, microprocessor applications, artificial intelligence, and fiber optics.

	Also, related work at Jones Energy & Automation, Inc. has given me experience building and developing new electronics systems. In particular, my work as an assembler taught me the importance of precision and quality control. I would like the opportunity to apply this knowledge at McDuff.

	Enclosed is my résumé, which focuses on the skills gained from my work experience and academic coursework that would transfer to your firm. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you. Should any questions arise concerning the information on my résumé, please do not hesitate to contact me through the email address or telephone number provided above.
	
	Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to our meeting in the near future.

Sincerely,


John Smith
