ACADEMIC PROJECTS 

	•	“3-Dimensional analysis of chevron notched bar specimen by using computational fracture mechanics”
	•	Designed the chevron notched specimen of crack length to width ratios (a/w) ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, in ANSYS.
	•	Simulated the loading process in ANSYS, and evaluated the stress intensity factor for the chevron notched specimen of different a/w ratios.
	•	Plotted graphs and compared the results with experimental solutions from the literature.

	•	“Design and fabrication of energy generator from speed breakers”
	•	The mechanism consists of a vertical piston spring arrangement, which impinges pressurized fluid on the prime mover, and this rotates the shaft connected to the motor to generate electrical energy.
	•	The assembly was designed on Solid Works and later fabricated using select materials.
	•	Tests were conducted to measure the rpm of the shaft and the voltage generated. By determining the input mechanical energy and the output electrical energy, the efficiency was calculated.
