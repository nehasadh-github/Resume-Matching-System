ACADEMIC PROJECT
PARTIAL REPLACE OF FINE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE MIX DESIGN
Description: This paper reports on an experimental program to investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of fine aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag is the waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such that each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of copper slag. Copper slag is one of the materials that is considered as a waste which could have a promising future in construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates. For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests were conducted for various proportions of copper slag replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained results were compared with those of control concrete made with ordinary Portland cement and sand.
