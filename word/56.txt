Relevant Courses Undertaken:

	•	“Design, Development and Simulation of FSAE Vehicle” by Meta Wing Info Tech Pvt. 
	•	“Vocational Training” at Indian Oil Corporation Limited , Barauni , Bihar
	•	“Feel Employable” conducted by the CLHRD

 Projects Completed:	
	•	Eco Green Vehicle Challenge-2014 conducted by L.D.College of Engineering
Description: In the project, our team designed a front-wheel drive bicycle with a seat resembling that of a car. The bicycle fabricated was single framed with a bent below the driver’s seat which acted as a suspension system.
	•	Development of Electronically Controlled Proportioning Directional Servo Valve sponsored by KSCST, Bangaluru
Description: In this project, flow rate and pressure of hydraulic system is controlled by                                                                     intelligent electronic system. Directional Control Valve and DC Servo Motor is joined by flexible coupling and then connected to hydraulic system and the electronic system. Thus, through stepwise movement of spool of DCV, hydraulic system can be controlled as desired.
