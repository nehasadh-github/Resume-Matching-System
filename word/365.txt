2. PROJECT (PGDISHE):- “CHEMICAL RISK ANALYSIS”
              Safely managing the chemical in workplace is good for business and it is good for everyone!
It will improve employees’ safety and health. It will potentially introduce cost saving, through more effective work practice such as correct storage, handling, use and disposal procedure. Potential harm to the environment will also be reduced. This chemical safety guide is intended for small businesses. In particular, it provides guidance for completing our chemical risk analysis. A chemical risk analysis follows the same steps as a risk analysis for any other hazards in your workplace. There are three basic steps:
Identify the hazard: This involves identifying the chemical in our workplace and the hazards associated with them
Assess the risk: This involve assessing the risk from chemical or process in our workplace
Control the exposure: This involves considering the various recognized control measures to eliminate or reduce the risk.

 3. TRAINING:-KHAVARE INDUSTRIES

                        Mechanical  Engg. 2013-14
4. FINAL YEAR PROJECT (B.E.) :- “FLEXIBLE CONVEYOR”
             These conveyors can be used for any kind of loading and transporting of goods with efficient mode of moving bulk materials. The high flexibility and the wide range make it possible to use the conveyors in both permanent lines as well as in flexible modularized solutions. This is link mechanism conveyor which can be used for small units where the conveyor kept in small space, can be compressed and stretched to the required length and curvature and the jobs can roll on it through gravity to reach the destination for which hardly two people are required to transfer the material.
After the completion of the project work we tried its working in our college machine shop and we were pleased to note that it does meet the requirements for what it is meant.
