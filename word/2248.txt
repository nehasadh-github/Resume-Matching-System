DETAILED SCOPE OF WORK
	•	My basic orthopaedic training was from 1993-1996 at S.M.S Medical College which had an extremely busy trauma department. I learnt the fine art of hand surgery in my first year of orthopaedic training from Dr. V. K. Pande, an eminent hand surgeon. My second and third year of residency training was in trauma and spine surgery. I gradually became interested in ‘Reconstruction surgery of Joints’ and their anatomy and biomechanics.
	•	During the later part of my training, I spent three years of Senior Residency honing my skills in adult joint reconstruction. I have spent sufficient time in visiting finest centers of joint replacement surgery across the globe and learning from the masters in this field.
	•	Currently, the focus of my practice is joint replacement and revision surgery. I have performed more than 3000 joint replacements surgeries including computer assisted joint replacements and revision surgeries. I have also had a chance to do live surgeries  in other countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.
