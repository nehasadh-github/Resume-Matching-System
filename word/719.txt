Academic Project

	•	Project:  Electricity Generation by Windmill & Control with Microcontroller.

	•	Synopsis : This project aimed at detailed study and introduction of Wind Mill
                       technique to use renewable source of energy (Wind Energy) to convert it 
                       into Electrical energy. Developed the technique to automatically select
                       the available voltage to best voltage option for consumer with the help
                       of PIC 16f 628 microcontrollers, traic, step up transformer & load sensing
                       circuitry to provide desired terminal voltage.
