Current Employment


Software Engineer/Site Reliability Enginer






Software Engineer/Site Reliability Enginer







Software Engineer
 

Google, Site Reliability Engineering, Another Production Automation Project, September 2013 through present. I was asked to lead (technical leadership, component de- sign and integration, project management) a new production automation project that would replace several existing projects and add significant new capabilities to automation across Google. This project combines Python, C++, Java, and Go. It will soon include some web tech. I am an active enginer, but primarily at the 25% level due to my leadership require- ments (including the other automation project, below). Product launches in Q4 2013.
Google, Site Reliability Engineering, Production Automation, December 2007 through present. Joined new internal “production automation” project in Google’s Site Reliabil- ity group. Became Technical Lead (2009-) and soon after took responsibility for entire project. Functioned as software engineer, software architect, project manager, and any- thing else needed to continue growing the project. From 2011 through 2013, served as personel manager as well. Project was assumed dead when I took over, and grew two or- ders of magnitude under my leadership. This project is primarily Python, and I remain an active engineer as needed. We also have various bits of web tech, data analysis (including mapreduce) and integration points with other languages.
Google, Search Quality, Google Co-op and Custom Search, April 2006 through De- cember 2007. Worked on small team to develop Google’s public Custom Search product. Responsibilities included feature design and development (in conjunction with team) for frontend (C++, HTML, Javascript, ClearSilver) and backend (C++), tools for load testing and exploring public usage (Bash, Python), customer outreach (iGoogle Gadgets, devel- oper days, blog posts), and participate in a pager rotation to keep everything up-to-date and running (emergency fixes, planned roll-outs and upgrades).



Software Engineer
 Google, Search Quality, Search Result Ranking, November 2005 through April 2006. Worked with large team to improve quality of Google’s search results through data mining, machine learning, and advanced alorithms. On the side, I developed a novel tool for identi- fying sets of bad ranking results with common cause, from conception through beta testing and changing my manager’s mind with evidence of impact.

Undergraduate Researcher
 1997, developed Maple-based two- and three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction soft- ware for convex polytopes

Mathematics Fellow



Deployed Hardware and Software Systems
Internal Google Software	Jan 2006- I have design, built, and deployed several internal and customer-facing software systems at Google, related to ranking, Google Custom Search, and automation tools.

May 2005- First source release for my Logistic Regression with Truncated Regularized It-

LR-TRIRLS



AFC Active Learning



Auton Fast Classifiers (AFC)



Aethon Elevator Controller
 eratively Re-weighted Least Squares software. Licensed under the GNU General Public Li- cense (GPL), available at http://www.autonlab.org and http://komarix.org/ac/lr.
September 2004- Active learning software for scheduling roboticized pharmaceutical ex- periments (see AFC, below). I am responsible for the design, implementation, and main- tenance of this software. This software has been delivered to the sponsor, and will be maintained and distributed contingent on future contracts.
April 2002- Fast classification software for high-dimensional datasets. I provided new al- gorithms and eventually took over the entire software system, including the user interface, learner and and dataset framework, performance evaluation, and documentation. This soft- ware is still in use by the sponsor, is maintained regularly, and has been widely distributed.
January 2002- Software for managing a single-board computer and serial interface board connected to an elevator’s control system. I developed a protocol and daemons for bidirec- tional communication between a mobile robot and a passenger elevator. Aethon’s current elevator controller is a derivative of my prototype.



Aethon Wireless Relays
 January 2002- Stand-alone devices for ad-hoc relaying of communications between mobile robots and an elevator controller (above). I selected the embedded hardware, created a small GNU/Linux operating system and installation utilities adapted to compact flash, and wrote the message relay software. Aethon’s current version of this device is a derivative of my prototype.


Auton Build System	-July 2001- I maintain the makefile and scripts used for building all Auton software on various compilers, microprocessors, and POSIX-ish environments.

-January 2000- Servers, compute machines, storage and services used by Auton lab mem- bers for research. My responsibilities include
	•	hardware and software selection, procurement, and deployment
	•	maximizing performance for niche scientific needs on a limited capital budget in a university environment

Auton Compute Infrastructure








Tomographic Reconstruction Software
	•	 maintaining vendor relationships and negotiating affordable prices
	•	understanding the current high-performance and consumer computing markets, both for our needs and for occasional advisement of clients and other academics.
	•	maintaining software, security, and services
This collection of user and server systems is used daily and maintained constantly. Some responsibilities have been shared with additional admins since Spring 2002.
Fall 1996 Software package for reconstructing a density function over a convex polytope using only information from (n-1)-dimensional integrals (“x-rays”). I developed this soft- ware for a math professor to use as part of his Geometric Tomography classes.

Personal
When outdoors I enjoy soccer, hiking, travel and photography. Indoors, I dabble in electronics and use my embedded computing experience for entertainment. I like to combine software, hardware, woodworking and metalworking to complete “essential” upgrades to our home, including a small home theater.
