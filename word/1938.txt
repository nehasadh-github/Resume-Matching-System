**Note: as explained at www.cra.org (Computing Research Association), regarding evidence of accomplish- ment in the field of computer science, conference publication is preferred6. Specifically, conference publication

is preferred to journal publication, and the premier conferences are generally more selective than the premier journals (Academic Careers, National Academy Press, 1994). This tradition is at variance with conventional academic publication traditions. Conference publication in the computer science field is both rigorous and prestigious.

Comments from students on course evaluation forms and from peer evaluation

“You were one of the best professors I have had in the program.”

“I feel elevated to be in your Data mining class. I haven’t seen or come across a Professor in my academic career who taught like you. I appreciate your efforts in that regard.”

“I really enjoyed your class. Thank you so much!”

“Thank you very much. Dr. Borne. I enjoyed the class and I am going to try looking for a job in data mining.”

“Thank you very much for everything. It is really nice to have you as professor for this semester. I have learned so many new and interesting things which can be applied at my work place in future. Hope our paths will cross sometime in future and I definitely look forward for that. Thank you once again for being such a wonderful professor.”

“You really worked hard in our class (probably at least three times as hard as most professors), and it was definitely the best class I’ve ever taken.”

“I’ve taken a lot of courses now at UMUC, 11 total, and your data mining course was the best laid out and executed by far. I enjoyed it very much and if I had to pick an area to consider specializing in, data mining looks really interesting. I’d attribute that to your course and your student interaction. Thanks again for making such a great course for us.”


“You have been a model professor. It has been a pleasure to be your student.”

“I truly enjoyed the class and can say that I learned the most compared to any other MS class so far.  I am     not sure when I will get chance to practice data mining, but definitely this class gave prospective and good idea to where to start from, what to expect and what options are available.”

“Dr. Borne is an excellent professor. He is well-organized, prepared, and provides his students with chal- lenging assignments that encourage critical thinking.  He is able to convey complex ideas with clarity by  using diagrams and examples.”

“Just to let you know – the response to your lecture on Tuesday was overwhelmingly positive. Students who are not always that interested said it was one of the best things they’ve ever heard.  One who had to leave  early apologized, he wanted to stay and shake your hand. These students saw something relevant in science  and they ate it up.”

“It has been extremely fun and interesting to listen to your lectures. I am so happy that I am in your class. Also I am so happy that I am in this department and believe I will learn so much and equip myself in many ways.”
