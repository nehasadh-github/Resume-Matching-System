  PROJECTS
	•	Done project on ROLE OF FACTS DEVICES IN IMPROVING POWER QUALITY IN A GRID CONNECTED RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM.

In this project we present the role of Facts devices in improving power quality in a grid connected renewable energy system. Recent trends in the power generation and distribution systems show that penetration level of DG into the grid has increased considerably.
End users appliances are becoming more sensitive to the power quality conditions. Extensive research on facts devices for the mitigation of PQ problems are also carried out. Facts devices are found to be very capable in integrating solar and wind energy sources to the grid.
Several FACTS devices have been introduced for various applications worldwide. A number of new types of devices are in the stage of being introduced in practice. Even more concepts of configuration of FACTS devices are discussed in research and literature.
In most of the applications the controllability is used to avoid cost intensive or landscape requiring extensions of power systems, for instance like grades or additions of substations and power lines. FACTS-devices provide a better adaptation to varying operational conditions and improve the usage of installations.
