INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
	•	Project Title	: HEV-Battery with Exhaust Environment- Thermal study
Role	: CAE Engineer
Tools	: CATIA, ANSA, Fluent
Scope	: To study battery thermal management for the different types of coolant domain designs.
	•	Project title	: Hybrid Car Cabin-air-environment -Thermal study
Role	: CAD Engineer
Tools	: CATIA, ANSA
Scope	: To build a fluid domain for the given car control model with Battery Compartment and generate the mesh for the entire domain

	•	Project title	: Simulation of Cavitation on Hydrofoil
Role	: CFD Engineer
Tools	: ANSA, T-Grid, Fluent
Scope	:	Cavitation	on	hydrofoils	causing	erosion	over	the	surface	due to separation. This project is intended to reduce the cavitation bubble.

	•	Project Title	: Simulation of Flow and Heat transfer in the CTP container
Role	: CFD Engineer-trainee,
Tools	: ANSA, T-Grid, Fluent
Scope	: CTP container consists of electronic panels. We need to reduce the temperature of the panels which emits heat by passing the cold air via A/C duct.
	•	Project title	: External Aerodynamics study over a car
Role	: CFD Engineer
Tools	: ANSA, T-Grid, Fluent
Scope	: To carry out external flow over a car to find Co-efficient of drag (CD), Flow behavior and pressure distribution on and around the vehicle.

	•	Project title	: Die design of Battery components for blow moulding
Role	: CAD Engineer
Tools	: CATIA V5, ANSA
Scope	: Model the die design as per the client requirement

ACADEMIC PROJECT
Title	: Power Generation by using Blade-tip Magnetization of Jet Engine

Description: This project was dealing with the generation of electric current using magnetic material at the tip of compressor blades and fan blades, coil in the engine cowling and walls of compressor. By this project the size of engine can be get reduced. The generator weight will be reduced in turn increase the efficiency of flight. This reduction in size will  reduce the drag produced by profile of engine. Obtained power was quite equals to present generator assembly.
