Academia

2009:	B.E. (ECE) from Ranchi University (Jharkhand) secured 72.88%marks.


Summer Internship

	•	Organisation: BSNL (Dhanbad)
	•	Duration:15days
	•	The project involved exclusive training on electronic switching exchange E10B and OCB-283 and in other related Sections, e.g. microwave and optical transmission, power supply, mobile section, main distribution frame.
Academic Project

Title: Estimation of electromagnetic interference in power line.
The project emphasised development of a theoretical model (a closed form approximation) for the Electromagnetic Interference from Power lines in the near field. The project involved power- line as communication channel & discuss existing problems associated with it.
Notable Attainments

Recipient of First prize in science exhibition for preparing model on traffic controlled environment.
The project involved a model of traffic controller using 555 timers operating as an a stable multi vibrator circuit, which continuously oscillates from one state to the other and thus control the traffic on road. Additionally, it also consists of a smoke sensor (or dark sensor) which is made using LDR.
