“Title: Location Variation Control in Steering Column Assembly by Jig Improvement.
          Our Project work is done in Hyundai Mobis Private India limited.
Description: we designed a new jig for the steering column, In old jig it looks with various drawbacks in its designs such as ignition lock issue, shaking condition, clamp deflection, column pipe damage, movement of steering column, lack of supporting clamp, defect in motor supporting stage and attachment for steering column etc., In order to overcome all those drawbacks, we all came up with an idea in concluding all these problems.
