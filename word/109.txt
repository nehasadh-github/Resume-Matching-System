WORK EXPERIANCE:

Total work experience of 12 year including 1.5 industry and 1.5 R&D..

1) Worked as a SOFTWARE ENGINEER at SAMSUNG INDIA ELECTRONICS LIMITED                                                       
         from DEC 2004 to APRIL 2005.
2) Worked as a PROJECT ASSISTANT Engineer At PRCD ISRO 
        from MAY 2003 to NOV     2004.

        from FEB 2002 to APRIL 2003.




PROJECTS HANDELED:
 ACADEMIC PROJECT:  
     1)     Microcontroller Based 12 Channel Announcers.
        It is firmware project in which we have used the AT89c51.The bit oriented Operation
        of the microcontroller is made used in this project. Whenever test button is pressed the  
         input channels are checked and accordingly corresponding channels o/p is conveyed  
         And announced. Turning of the siren is made by the reset buttons pressed.
      
 PROJECTS in C.A.T:
2) Maximum Power  Point Tracking System.
       Maximum PowerTracking System (MPPT) is used in Photovoltaic (PV) system to
       Maximize the PV array output irrespective of temperature. And Radiation, also local load  
       Electrical characteristics .the new MPPT system is developed in which controlling consist 
       Of buck type of DC-DC Converter that is controlled  by a microcontroller based unit.
3)   MP3 player.
     Portable MP3 player based on the PC. It uses an AT89C51.and AT90L/S8535 
     Microcontroller with its on board memory and STA013 decoder  and DAC. It supports for 
     RS232 communication with PC for down loading fo songs and from the internet.
   
PROJETS AT ISRO:
  4) Base Band Processing Module For Regenerative Payload Simulator.
 Aim of the project is to develop a simulator for the base band processing and switching module
  of the regenrative payload, which will recive the request from the user terminals . the input to 
  this module is request packet from extracted from signaling channel, and respective 
  demodulated signal of the channel to be switched.
5) TTC RF Power Monitoring System, POWERMETER.
   The aim of the project is to continuosly monitor the power level at Spacecraft end, setting 
   reference level within operating window with data logging and raise the alarm in case there is 
   drastic change in power level. The hardware consist of ADC, RS232, LCD, RAM, RTC and 
   battery backup with built in power supply. the system has been provided with built in buzzer 
   And external alram.the stand alone mode with internal battery verified for data rententivity
   long term stability of 120 hours.
6) DDS Based programmable wide band FM modulator.
   This project is to devlop a wideband digital FM modulator using DDS technique the generated 
   FM signal is to be used as RF uplink signal for satellite receversrs. Developed code for 
   microcontroller which programs AD9850 DDS chip.The controller sets center frequency by
   loading the tuning words in DDS chip.user can set the frequency and deviation. and phase
  Modulation words are loaded into the AD9850 via parallel byte.center frequency ranging from 
  10- 20MHz.modulating signal in the range of 283-30KHz.
  MTECH PROJECT:
7).Automatic weed detectection and smart herbicide sprayer robot for corn feilds
A vision-based guidance method is presented to guide a robot platform which is designed independently to drive through the crops in a field according to the design concept of open architecture. Then, the offset and heading angle of the robot platform are detected in real time to guide the platform on the basis of recognition of a crop using machine vision. This project is basically developed to implement a number of agricultural production in many countries, such as picking, harvesting, weeding, pruning, planting, grafting, agricultural classification etc.
